### Project Motivation

Gun violence is a persistent public health crisis in the United States. In New York City, for example, we had the [Midtown Manhattan mass shooting](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/03/us/manhattan-shooting-timeline-911-calls) in July 2025. It showed us that even our busiest, most protected neighborhoods are impacted by gun violence. We would like to perform a descriptive exploration of socioeconomic, geographic, and temporal factors that are potentially positively or negatively associated with firearm shootings. 

### Intended Final Products

Five separate analyses into the factors (see planned analyses) that contribute to gun violence within New York City, and one summary report combining and comparing the results of these five analyses.

### Anticipated Data Sources

- [Social conditions](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/social-conditions/?id=2317#display=summary)
- [American community survey](https://data.census.gov/all?q=American+Community+Survey)
- [Gun shooting data by year (historic, 2006-2024)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Year-To-Date-/5ucz-vwe8/about_data)
- [Gun shooting data 2025](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8/about_data)
- [Street lights data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/DOT-Street-Lights-and-Traffic-Signals-311-Service-/jwvp-gyiq)
- [Weather data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search)
- [Holiday data](https://www.redcort.com/us-federal-bank-holidays)

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

#### Exposures under consideration

- Social conditions treated as a confounder to the data and characterized by open green spaces within each studied region (boro/neighborhood/zip code/etc)
- Street light/lighting in the area, time of day
- Weather/time of year (seasonality)
  - Holidays/day of week
  - focus on COVID-19’s influence (1/20/2020 first case in USA)
- Location (zip code / neighborhood / boro)
- Victim gender

##### Other preliminary analyses that may be done

- By precinct
- By boro – compare base numbers vs rate by population size
- Inside vs outside
- By location classification
- By latitude/longitude
- Murder flag
- By time (day/morning/etc)
- Holidays
- Seasonality
- Weather
- Other demographic info

#### Visualizations

- Maps comparing locational information, using latitudinal/longitudinal information
- Other visualizations identified and applied as appropriate throughout the analysis process

#### Coding Challenges

Handling missing or inconsistent data across multiple sources might be challenging.

### The planned timeline

- Nov 7: submit proposal
- Nov 10-14: project review meeting
- Nov 21: group check-in on analysis progress
- Nov 26 or 28: finish all analyses, start putting together the group report
- Dec 2-4: finalize project state so the video can be recorded
- Dec 6: project due
